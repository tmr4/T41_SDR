3. csdr (https://github.com/ha7ilm/csdr)

%% csdr NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE
=========================================

Most of the code of libcsdr is under BSD license.
However, before the implementation of some algoritms, GPL-licensed code from other applications have been reviewed. In order to eliminate any licesing issues, these parts are placed under a different file. However, the library is still fully functional with BSD-only code, altough having only less-optimized versions of some algorithms.
It should also be noted that if you compile with -DUSE_FFTW and -DLIBCSDR_GPL (as default), the GPL license would apply on the whole result.
